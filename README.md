## Contributing
Contributing to **Procedural Designs** is very easy!

Just look for the `designs.js` file, add a p5.js sketch using instance mode, and replace:
```javascript
new p5(mydesign);
```
with:
```javascript
publish(mydesign, "Example", "Example Author");
```
(replace all of the arguments with a sketch, a design name, and an author name)!

## Inspiration
The **inspiration** comes from [Community Clouds](https://github.com/CodingTrain/CommunityClouds/), and [the Recode Project](http://recodeproject.com/).

### Community Clouds
**Community Clouds** is a project full of "Algorithmicly-Generated Clouds". This relates to Processing Day/Processing Community day. More information at https://github.com/CodingTrain/CommunityClouds/.

### The Recode Project
The **Recode Project** is (like this project), a collection of procedural designs. I just want you to be able to animate your design. This is where this additional **Procedural Designs** project comes in. More information at http://recodeproject.com.
